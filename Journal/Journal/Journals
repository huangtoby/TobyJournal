-Today our group discussed about which games our projects will be based on
-We thought of two different game ideas. They were One Way Heroics and Evoland
-So we came to a conclusion that we will use the theme of both One Way Heroics and Evoland
-Our many idea is the same concept as One Way Heroic; which is to run "one way" away from a chasing "evil"
-We also plan to add the idea of Evoland which has chests appear in game which contains additional game 
	"features" to the game itself
-Tomorrow we plan to actually start to add necessary classes
-We also plan to think of a theme for the game (the bad guys, the chasing "evil", obstacles, items, and storyline)
