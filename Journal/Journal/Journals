-Today our group discussed about which games our projects will be based on
-We thought of two different game ideas. They were One Way Heroics and Evoland
-So we came to a conclusion that we will use the theme of both One Way Heroics and Evoland
-Our many idea is the same concept as One Way Heroic; which is to run "one way" away from a chasing "evil"
-We also plan to add the idea of Evoland which has chests appear in game which contains additional game 
	"features" to the game itself
-Tomorrow we plan to actually start to add necessary classes
-We also plan to think of a theme for the game (the bad guys, the chasing "evil", obstacles, items, and storyline)


May 5,2017
-Today our group thought through what we will need for the project and then created some necessary classes
-We also ended up giving up the One Way Heroics idea and went with the Evoland game concept
-We also thought about how our game will start out and end (theme)
-I started to work on the hero class (KeyListening and extending customized classes)
-Next time we plan to continue to work on the classes and further think of our overall structure of game
-I also plan to collect graphics and pictures for the "hero"

May 8,2017
-Today we continued to try to understand our project's structure since we stuck on how to implement our class game 
	engine to our project
-We are indecisive on using a game engine we found online, Slick2D, to continue using our class engine
-We would have to come to a conclusion asap so we can have time to learn and code  

May 9,2017
-Today our group ended up changing our whole project. We will not be using our class game engine anymore but will be using 
	Slick2D engine
-We spend most of our time today looking at videos about how to start up the project and how to import slick
-Even though the concept of the engine is similar to our class one, there are still different naming and structuring
-We were able to make a new project with the slick jar and a few classes to start
-Tomorrow we are planning to start adding things to our screen (including the menu, hero, map)
 
May 10,2017
-Today I was able to add in my character and did my keyboard inputing for character movement
-I'm also working on making my own buttons for the menu/inventory so that they could match our game theme
-Tomorrow I plan to add actions to our buttons like screen changing
-We also need to draw a visual of our map so we can start coding it into our game (trees,obstacles,chest,and monster placements)

May 12,2017
-Today I continue to work on my hero character
-I was able to add positioning and "animation" to the character
-I am not sure how it would look on the screen since we are having trouble with our jar files and running the engine
-There seems to be an error with a jar import we found from online
-Next time I am planning to work on the menu and making my character visuals better

May 15,2017
-Today I go the hero's movements to work (including walking and running) on the "map"
-I also added a random map for testing purposes so I can test the collision and movements
-Tomorrow I plan to work on collision (not walking off the map or crashing into other things)
-I also plan to make an original and custom map/maze for our game (still looking for a better application to make one)
