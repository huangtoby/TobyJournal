-Today our group discussed about which games our projects will be based on
-We thought of two different game ideas. They were One Way Heroics and Evoland
-So we came to a conclusion that we will use the theme of both One Way Heroics and Evoland
-Our many idea is the same concept as One Way Heroic; which is to run "one way" away from a chasing "evil"
-We also plan to add the idea of Evoland which has chests appear in game which contains additional game 
	"features" to the game itself
-Tomorrow we plan to actually start to add necessary classes
-We also plan to think of a theme for the game (the bad guys, the chasing "evil", obstacles, items, and storyline)

-Today our group thought through what we will need for the project and then created some necessary classes
-We also ended up giving up the One Way Heroics idea and went with the Evoland game concept
-We also thought about how our game will start out and end (theme)
-I started to work on the hero class (KeyListening and extending customized classes)
-Next time we plan to continue to work on the classes and further think of our overall structure of game
-I also plan to collect graphics and pictures for the "hero"
